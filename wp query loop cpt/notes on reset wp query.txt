custom cpt wp query resets the wp query and u cant get custom fields after that in template

to fix that use 

<?php
// we initiated custom query - got results and then 
// we are initiating regular query again so that we can proceed with acf fields again
global $wp_query;
while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

.... 


<?php endwhile; // End loop ?>
